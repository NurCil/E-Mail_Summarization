# E-Mail_Summarization

It is an extractive text summarization tool for e-mail messages. Under the section "Dataset" you can summarize your e-mails optionally from a txt-file, which you can save under your Google Drive folder or use the section with the e-mail message examples.
The tool consists of two parts: 
1. Preprocessing of the e-mail messages. --> Modification of preprocessing-part of the Python-file email_summarization.py (Chauhan, 2018) from https://github.com/jatana-research/email-summarization.
2. Process of e-mail summarization. --> Using the 'Automatic Text Summarizer' from https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy.
